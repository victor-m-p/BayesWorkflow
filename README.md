# BayesWorkflow
Bayesian workflow in R (brms) and Python (PyMC3).

Made for the user who wants to transition from R (brms) to Python (pyMC3) or
the other way.

Originates as exam project for Cognitive Science Master's course Human
Computer Interaction (HCI).

# Code-base

## Streamlit
Link to **Streamlit** app: https://share.streamlit.io/victor-m-p/bayesworkflow/main/BayesWorkflow.py

The python document which runs the streamlit app is BayesWorkflow.py

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the **Python** analysis as shown in the streamlit app
run the bash script in code\_python/run\_python.sh.
This script will run the necessary .py scripts.
This requires that your environment is set up with the appropriate
packages (update this).

To reproduce **R** analysis as shown in the streamlit app
run the bash script in code\_R/run\_R.sh.
This will convert the .Rmd documents to .R scripts and
then execute the .R scripts necessary to reproduce everything.

## Report
To see the report, navigate to the report folder,
and choose the .pdf file.

## Figures and Plots
To access the figures and plots generated by the **R**
and **Python** analyses navigate to the plots\_R and
the plots\_python folders.
