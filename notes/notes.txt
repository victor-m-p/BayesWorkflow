## To-do

## Remember:
1. used backages should probably be stated.
2. showing code and running code without double labour.
3. formatting text in code style.
4. change the theme (cannot just be copied)..
5. linking to people / other pages.
6. prediction vs. fitting (we should have prediction as well).
7. sub-section for sidebar?
8. should we have the cache thing?
9. "overthinking" both for math-ish and for R code.
