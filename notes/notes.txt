## To-do

## Remember:
1. used backages should probably be stated.
2. showing code and running code without double labour.
3. formatting text in code style.
4. change the theme (cannot just be copied)..
5. linking to people / other pages.
6. prediction vs. fitting (we should have prediction as well).
7. sub-section for sidebar?
8. should we have the cache thing?
9. "overthinking" both for math-ish and for R code.


## R: call R from python
1. rpy2: https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2
2. subprocesses: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/89228/how-to-execute-a-program-or-call-a-system-command-from-python/89243#89243

## problems with R:
1. plots from command line: https://github.com/cscheid/rplot/blob/master/rplot

## New ideas
1. Why streamlit not Shiny
2. be very clear about who the target group is and what they should get out of this product.

## Technical:
1. pre-render models with different priors.
2. Mikkels link.
3. priors influence on model comparison.
4. update without refit in R. (save & load properly in PyMC3).
5. stanvars.
6. brug cache.
7. eval() for displaying output.
8. check the thing with running other code while it is running (brms).
9. consider a function which both does prior "only" and prior TRUE. 
