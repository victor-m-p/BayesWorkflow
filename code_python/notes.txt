Generally for writing:

## python usage
tried to strike a balance between (a) optimal code practise
in python and (b) what is accessible for the students.
I.e. it should not be necessary to be a python genious to follow along.
For instance, I chose to not implement all of this as a class,
since object oriented programming is unfamiliar for most of
the students in the target group.

## pymc3 vs. brms
it stands to reason that the workflow in brms and in pymc3
is not the same. I.e., some things are easier/more natural in pymc3 (python) and
some things are easier/more natural in brms (R).
In these cases I have tried to strike a balance between not presenting
a markedly worse workflow as compared to what is possible, but keeping
the parallels between pymc3 and brms pretty direct.

## how it is intended to be used
(1) recalling how to do things. just quickly looking in to find something.
(2) read once as a pretty deep primer to start pymc3 from R.

# structure
1. main
2. prediction (shared variables)
3. models deep dive.
--> perhaps in pop-ups, or different pages.
